// Tukar — Compliance circuit (ASP membership + non-membership)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Proves, at a corridor edge, that the source of funds is compliant — WITHOUT
// revealing which member it is:
//   * MEMBERSHIP: the source key is in the ASP allow-list (Merkle inclusion in
//     the allow-list tree, root public),
//   * NON-MEMBERSHIP: the source key is not any of the publicly known
//     sanctioned/deny-listed keys.
// `bindHash` is a public signal the POOL pins to the deposit commitment (it appears
// in-circuit only as a squaring so the optimizer can't drop it — it is NOT bound to
// sourceKey/path inside the circuit). Detach-resistance in the deposit flow comes from
// two other places: the pool pins sourceKey == field(from) with require_auth(from), and
// a separate disclosure/binding proof ties commitment <-> amount.
//
// This is the direct on-chain realization of the Privacy Pools whitepaper's
// "association set" model (Buterin, Soleimani, et al.).
//
// Public  : aspRoot, denyList[nDeny], sourceKey, bindHash
// Private : pathElements[levels], leafIndex
//
// sourceKey is PUBLIC: the pool sets it to a field derived from the authenticated
// depositor (`field(from)`), so the proof shows that *this depositor* is an
// allow-listed source — not merely that some allow-listed source exists. The
// membership witness (path) is still private.
