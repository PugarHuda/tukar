// Tukar — Threshold (range) Selective Disclosure circuit
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A stronger-privacy sibling of disclosure.circom. Instead of revealing the EXACT
// amount to a regulator, the holder proves a *predicate* about it — "this payment
// is at most the reporting threshold" — WITHOUT disclosing the amount itself.
//
// This is the compliance primitive real reporting rules want: prove you are under
// (or over) a threshold, keep the exact figure private. The regulator learns only
// the public threshold and that the commitment satisfies it.
//
//     commitment = Poseidon(amount, pubKey, blinding)   (same binding as deposit)
//     proven fact: amount <= threshold                  (amount stays hidden)
//
// Public  inputs : commitment, threshold, auditContextHash
// Private inputs : amount, pubKey, blinding
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
